# CS370
The work contributed to this repository is for assignments that were designed for an undergraduate operating systems course.
The homework descriptions can be seen [here](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~wmm24/cs370_su15/project.html) and include adding
system calls, adding a "mailbox" mechanism for IPC, redesigning the scheduler, and implementing a FAT file system reader.
